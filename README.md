this is a backup of my opml (come at me but don't @ me).

# why
I'm making an RSS reader and Claude might eat my lunch.

# what is OPML

[OPML](http://opml.org/spec2.opml) (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML format for exchanging lists of RSS feeds between feed readers. Most RSS readers can import and export OPML files, making it the standard way to back up or migrate your subscriptions.

## importing

To use this file, import `donthypeme-feeds.opml` into your RSS reader:

- **Feedly**: Organize > Import OPML
- **Inoreader**: Preferences > Import/Export > Import OPML
- **NetNewsWire**: File > Import Subscriptions
- **Miniflux**: Settings > Import > OPML file
- **FreshRSS**: Subscription management > Import/Export > Import OPML

Most other readers have a similar import option — look for "Import", "OPML", or "Subscriptions" in settings.

## exporting

To update this backup, export your feeds as OPML from your reader and replace `donthypeme-feeds.opml`.
